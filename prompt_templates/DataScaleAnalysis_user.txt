I need to do some verification tasks on the program, but the verification is very difficult because the data scale is large or uncertain. Please analyze whether the semantic logic of the program is directly related to the size of the data scale variable. In short, the large or small data scale will not affect the process or results of the program. I want to use this to determine whether the program can be optimized for the data scale. Please note that programs involving arrays will have variables that control the data size, while programs that do not involve arrays have semantic logic that is unrelated to the data scale. Please analyze carefully.
Please think step by step.
The code is as follows:
