Based on your analysis, answer whether the logical semantics of the program is directly related to the size of the data scale variable. Note that programs that contain arrays usually have variables that control data scale. If the program does not contain arrays, then no data scale optimization is needed, and the answer is false; if the program contains arrays, but the logical semantics of the program is not related to data scale, then data scale optimization can be done, and the answer is true; if the program contains arrays, but the logical semantics of the program is related to data scale, then data scale optimization cannot be done, and the answer is false.
