Now please modify the program provided above with the idea of ​​testing, and generate a C program that meets the following requirements:
Based on your analysis above, since you think there is a state in the program that will cause an assertion error (that is, the program analyzed above triggers reach_error()), then please use the scanf statement in the program in the order of assignment to give a set of specific assignments that may cause an assertion error (that is, trigger reach_error()), and output these specific assignments through the printf statement. If the variable to be assigned (that is, the variable that needs to be assigned through the scanf statement) is assigned in a loop, then please try to use the loop output unless you can guarantee that the loop terminates with a limited number of assignments. Please only reply to the program code to ensure that I can get the parameter value you assigned after running this program.
Instructions:
- Pay attention to the value restrictions that may exist in the program.
Rules:
- The output of the program you reply must be the same as the input of the program provided.
- The input of the program provided must be the output of the program you reply.
- The program code you provide should be as small as possible, that is, you only need to output the appropriate assignments you think, and do not keep the parts that are not related to the output of the variable value to be assigned, so as to ensure that the program is as short as possible.
- You must only assign variables with random values ​​and not other non-random variables.
- The output program you give cannot contain scanf input, because I want to run the program you give to get the output.
