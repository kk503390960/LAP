Now, your task is to check whether the above program triggers the reach_error function during operation, that is, whether the assertion is always true. Please analyze all possible states of the program (the state must meet the assumptions in the program). The state here can be understood as a set of randomly assigned variable values ​​in the program. When analyzing, please note that if there is a state that makes the assertion false (that is, triggering the reach_error function), then this state must be caused by the randomly assigned variables. If you think there is a state in the program that makes the assertion false, please describe this state in detail, analyze how the state assignment will cause the assertion to be false, and give a specific assignment. If you analyze that there is a state that makes the assertion false, but you cannot give a specific assignment for this state, you will be punished.
Please think step by step.
